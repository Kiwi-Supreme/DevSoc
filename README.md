Escape-VIT aka escaVIT(sounds like escape-it) is an app designed to help VIT students check the crowd density of areas on and around campus and find peaceful spots to escape the hustle and bustle. The app gives real-time crowd insights by detecting the density of people who have it installed.

EscaVIT helps you decide whether to visit the library during FATs or find a quieter spot to study; or a vacant hangout spot outside campus.
